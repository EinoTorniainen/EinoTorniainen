# ðŸ‘‹ Hi
- I am Eino Torniainen. (HÃ¤n/HÃ¤n)
- I am from Finland.
- I played a acoustic drumset for ~9 years, but quit/took a break because of studying. Nowadays I just play videogames and read ~~comic~~books.
- I have knowledge on many things. I just can't remember anything.
- I expect my studies to be painful.
- I plan to make enough money to have to pay taxes.
- This is what I look like.
